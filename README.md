## Moderation rules

Since 2014 when we started this community, there are rules that we all agree on as to the fundamental ground.

0. We keep the community separate from anyone/companies' interests.
1. Treat everyone with respect and kindness.
2. Be thoughtful in how you communicate.
3. Don't be destructive or inflammatory.
4. No blatant NSFW.
5. No spam or self-promotion without permission from a staff member.

### Communication

There are always newbies who join us and ask your already-known questions. In those cases, we decide to guide them through the knowledge rather than throw them the LMGTFY URLs.

We build the Golang Vietnam community out of trust and faith that if you can help one person, he will stick around and help the others. That's the common ground.

### Promotion & Job Ads

We create the [`jobs` repo](https://github.com/golang-vietnam/jobs/issues) to centralize all the job posts. Golang is one of the friendly programming languages out there, and companies always look for new gophers from our community. Too many job ads will turn the chat room into the jobs site. No real technical discussions there. And we don't want it.

Please post to [`jobs` repo](https://github.com/golang-vietnam/jobs/issues), and the moderators will help to release the 
In the meantime, you can pm the gophers and send them the offers.
