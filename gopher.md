## Understanding of [go proverbs](http://go-proverbs.github.io)

- [ ] Don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating.
- [ ] Concurrency is not parallelism.
- [ ] Channels orchestrate; mutexes serialize.
- [ ] The bigger the interface, the weaker the abstraction.
- [ ] Make the zero value useful.
- [ ] interface{} says nothing.
- [ ] Gofmt's style is no one's favorite, yet gofmt is everyone's favorite.
- [ ] A little copying is better than a little dependency.
- [ ] Syscall must always be guarded with build tags.
- [ ] Cgo must always be guarded with build tags.
- [ ] Cgo is not Go.
- [ ] With the unsafe package there are no guarantees.
- [ ] Clear is better than clever.
- [ ] Reflection is never clear.
- [ ] Errors are values.
- [ ] Don't just check errors, handle them gracefully.
- [ ] Design the architecture, name the components, document the details.
- [ ] Documentation is for users.
- [ ] Don't panic.
